//Library to control the LTC1296 (ALL CHANNELS CONFIGURED AS UNIPOLAR)
//
//
//This library contains the functions to make the temperature ADC conversions
//
//
//It is necessary to define in the main program the SPI configuration with #USE SPI (stream=SP, ...)
//It is also necessary to define the Chip select pin CS. Example #DEFINE CS_LTC1296 pin_A4
//It is also necessary to include the stdint library in the main program before this one. Ex: #include <stdint.h> #include <LTC1296.c>
